## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Foreground notifications not showing

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Look for "‚úÖ FCM handlers initialized" in logs.

### Issue: Navigation not working

**Check custom data format in Firebase Console:**
- Keys must be exact: `notificationType`, `referenceNumber`
- Values must be strings: `"1"` not `1`

### Issue: Background/Terminated not showing

**Check:**
1. Notification permissions granted
2. google-services.json in android/app/
3. Package name matches everywhere
